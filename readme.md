# G4MPI Examples

## ‚≠ê About this project


## üîß Requirements
* Ubuntu 20.04 (Tested)
* Geant4.10.07 (Tested)
* MPICH 3.3.2 

#### a) Geant4 installation
- Open Ubuntu Terminal and type the following commands to update Ubuntu system.
    ```c++
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

- Installing pre-package using the following commands
    ```c++
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential apt-file gcc g++ autoconf automake automake1.11 tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxt-dev libxmu-dev libglew-dev libglw1-mesa-dev gfortran inventor-dev libxaw7-dev freeglut3-dev libxerces-c-dev libxmltok1-dev qt5-default libxi-dev libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 cmake libxmlrpc-core-c3-dev tclxml tclxml-dev libexpat1-dev libgtk2.0-dev libxpm-dev x11proto-gl-dev x11proto-input-dev -y
    sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev python libssl-dev gfortran libpcre3-dev xlibmesa-glu-dev libglew1.5-dev libftgl-dev libmysqlclient-dev libfftw3-dev libcfitsio-dev graphviz-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libldap2-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev libgsl0-dev qtwebengine5-dev
    ```
- I assumed that I want to install Geant4 in path ../Software/
- Create a new "Geant4" inside "Softwares" folder 
- Create 2 new folders named "build" and "install" inside "Geant4" folder.
- Copy Geant4 source code that downloaded from Geant4 Homepage to "Geant4" folder and rename to "source".
- Download all data files and extract to "data" folder that created inside "Geant4" folder.
- We will have 4 folders

    ../Softwares/Geant4/\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install\
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ source

- Let open Terminal in "build" folder and type
    ```c++
    $ cmake -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR=../data \
    -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON \
    -DGEANT4_USE_HDF5=OFF \
    -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON \
    -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON \
    -DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON \ 
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
    ../source
    $ make -j4
    $ sudo make install
    ```
- Add "geant4.sh" and "geant4make.sh" to at the end of file "/home/user_name/.bashrc", for example
    ```c++
    source "/home/hungbt/Softwares/Geant4/install/bin/geant4.sh"
    source "/home/hungbt/Softwares/Geant4/install/share/Geant4-10.7.4/geant4make/geant4make.sh"
    ```

#### b) Install MPICH
- Download MPICH [here](https://www.mpich.org/downloads/versions/)
- Create a new folder to contain source and install folder. For example, I created "mpich3.3.2" in "software" folder.
- Extract source pakace into "mpich3.2.2"
- Create a new folder named "install"
- Open terminal in source folder and type commands line by line
    ```c++
    $ ./configure --prefix=/home/hungbt/Softwares/mpich3.3.2/install
    $ make -j4
    $ sudo make install
    ```
- Add ".../install/bin" folder to path
    ```c++
    export PATH=/home/hungbt/Softwares/mpich3.3.2/install/bin:$PATH
    ```
- Add lib folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```c++
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/hungbt/Softwares/mpich3.3.2/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
#### c) Install G4MPI source
- Create a new folder name "G4MPI" inside "Softwares" folder
- Copy "source" folder in "/home/hungbt/Softwares/Geant4.10.07/source/examples/extended/parallel/MPI" to "G4MPI" folder
- Create 2 new folders "build" and "install"
- Type 

    ```c++
    $ cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/home/hungbt/Softwares/Geant4.10.07/install/lib/Geant4-10.7.4 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/hungbt/Softwares/G4MPI/install ../source
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to run
- Create a new folder to build example. For example, I created "bld" folder.
    ```c++
    cd exMPI03
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    ```
- Build
    ```c++
    $ cmake -DG4mpi_DIR=/home/hungbt/Softwares/G4MPI/install/lib/G4mpi-10.7.4 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DGeant4_DIR=/home/hungbt/Softwares/Geant4.10.07/install/lib/Geant4-10.7.4 ../
    $ make -j4
    ```
- Run example in interactive mode
    ```c++
    ./SimApp
    ```
- Run example in batch mode
    ```c++
    $ mpiexec -np 4 ./exMPI03 run.mac
    ```
